    <p class="content">
      This classic baked mac and cheese recipe with a buttered bread crumb
      topping is creamy and comforting. It's easy to make the cheese sauce from
      scratch on your stovetop, starting with a roux and adding milk, Cheddar,
      and Parmesan, resulting in a rich, decadent sauce that coats every nook
      and cranny of the noodles. Serve this comfort-food macaroni and cheese
      casserole with grilled meats, sloppy Joes, fried chicken or alongside a
      salad for a meatless dinner.
