      </p>
      <h2 id="rcorners">Ingredients</h2>
      <ul class="content">
        <li><strong>Yeast</strong></li>
        <p>
          Active dry yeast is a leavening agent, which means it's the ingredient
          that causes the pizza dough to rise.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Sugar</strong></li>
        <p>
          To activate your yeast, you'll need to dissolve it in warm water with
          a teaspoon of sugar. The sugar gives the yeast something to eat and
          speeds up the activation process. You'll know your yeast is active
          when it becomes bubbly and frothy on top.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Bread Flour</strong></li>
        <p>
          Bread flour is ideal for pizza crust becauseit creates chewier results
          than all-purpose flour. This is because it contains more protein,
          which helps produce lots of gluten. Gluten is what gives the crust
          elasticity.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Olive Oil</strong></li>
        <p>
          Olive oil serves a couple purposes when it comes to pizza crust: Not
          only does it add color and flavor, but it creates a barrier between
          the oil and water. This oily barrier prevents sogginess.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Salt</strong></li>
        <p>
          A little bit of salt goes a long way. Salt adds flavor, strengthens
          the gluten (creating a chewier crust), and slows down fermentation
          (resulting in a better rise).
        </p>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="rcorners">How to make</h2>
      <ol class="content">
        <li><strong>Step</strong></li>
        <p>
          Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Lightly grease a pizza
          pan.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step</strong></li>
        <p>
          Place warm water in a bowl; add yeast and sugar. Mix and let stand
          until creamy, about 10 minutes.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step</strong></li>
        <p>
          Add flour, oil, and salt to the yeast mixture; beat until smooth. You
          can do this by hand or use a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook to
          make it easier. Let rest for 5 minutes.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step</strong></li>
        <p>
          Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and pat or roll into a
          12-inch circle. Transfer to the prepared pizza pan.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step</strong></li>
        <p>Spread crust with sauce and toppings of your choice.</p>
        <li><strong>Step</strong></li>
        <p>
