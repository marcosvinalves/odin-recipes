      <h2 id="rcorners">Ingredients</h2>
      <ul class="content">
        <li><strong>Chicken</strong></li>
        <p>
          Boneless, skinless chicken breasts (cut into cubes) are ideal for
          making classic chicken pot pie.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Vegetables</strong></li>
        <p>
          This chicken pot pie recipe calls for the usual suspects: peas,
          carrots, onions, and celery. You could toss in some mushrooms or green
          peppers if you want to incorporate more veggies.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Butter and Flour</strong></li>
        <p>
          The chicken pot pie filling starts with a roux made with butter and
          all-purpose flour.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Seasonings</strong></li>
        <p>
          Achieve the perfect cozy flavor with salt, pepper, and celery seed. Of
          course, you can add more seasonings to suit your taste.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Broth and Milk</strong></li>
        <p>
          Chicken broth and milk add depth of flavor and help create a smooth
          and decadent chicken pot pie filling consistency.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Pie Crusts</strong></li>
        <p>You'll need two unbaked pie crusts.</p>
      </ul>
      <h2 id="rcorners">How to make</h2>
      <ol class="content">
        <li><strong>Step</strong></li>
        <p>Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.)</p>
        <li><strong>Step</strong></li>
        <p>
          Combine chicken, carrots, peas, and celery in a saucepan; add water to
          cover and bring to a boil. Boil for 15 minutes, then remove from the
          heat and drain.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step</strong></li>
        <p>
          While the chicken is cooking, melt butter in another saucepan over
          medium heat. Add onion and cook until soft and translucent, 5 to 7
          minutes. Stir in flour, salt, pepper, and celery seed. Slowly stir in
          chicken broth and milk. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until
          thick, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step</strong></li>
        <p>
          Place chicken and vegetables in the bottom pie crust. Pour hot liquid
          mixture over top. Cover with top crust, seal the edges, and cut away
          any excess dough. Make several small slits in the top crust to allow
          steam to escape.
        </p>
        <li><strong>Step</strong></li>
        <p>
          Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is golden brown and filling is
          bubbly, 30 to 35 minutes. Cool for 10 minutes before serving.
