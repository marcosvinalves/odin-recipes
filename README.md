<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p></p>
<p>On this project I'll be making a simple website using the current lessons from <Strong>The Odin Project</Strong>. This will be my first project 
from the course. At the moment, I hasn't learned CSS, so all the code will be HTML only. As I progress, this project will be modified. :)</p>
