<h1>Odin Recipes Project</h1>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes.</p>
<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Greetings,</p>
<p></p>
<p>On this project I'll be making a simple website using the current lessons from <Strong>The Odin Project</Strong>. This will be my first project 
from the course. At the moment, I hasn't learned CSS, so all the code will be HTML only. As I progress, this project will be modified. :)</p>
<h2>What I learned on the project:</h2>
<p>I'm writing this a few weeks after a finished the project, but the things I learned making the project was:<p>
<ul>
<li>Align the content and itens on the page (without flexbox).</li>
<li>Some concepts of building layouts.</li>
<li>How to use some very basics CSS properties.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What I had difficulty on the project</h2>
<ul>
<li>Making the logo, since I haven't learned about margin, gap and padding. So I had to make a image containing all the parts of the logo, the name of the page, the icon and the slogan.</li>
<li>Change the default font for a external font.</li>
<li>Align the main page items, I had to create them as a button element (containing the recipe image and the name of the recipe), and center it with the align-items propertie inside their div element.</li>
</ul>
